# ThisTextDoesNotExist
Inspired by "This Person Does Not Exist," this Machine Learning model utilizes several different architectures - namely RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers - to generate text at varying levels of coherence. This model also features implementations of multiple word embedding techniques, including word2vec and fastText, to compare results between different spatial representations of words. 

Created by three curious high school friends who were eager to explore the vast world of LLMs and NLP!
